Explorations of language-related content.  
I have been exploring NLP options using Python and R. 

At this point, the reository includes files related to the following projects:

1. Food Prices: The project analyzes a REDDIT discussion on the question of whether food prices in the US are higher than in Europe. The original discussion can be found here: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEurope/comments/k368j9/why_are_grocery_prices_so_much_lower_in_europe/

The files in this repository are free to use for personal and academic purposes, but not for commercial purposes.
