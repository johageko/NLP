Food I'm aware this is a generalization but whenever I'm in Europe, I'm puzzled by the low prices for wine, cheese, meat, fresh produce etc, even in otherwise more expensive countries (Netherlands, Germany, Austria, France, Belgium, etc.).

I think food prices in Spain are higher than the UK but I know Belgian and Danish people who think food here is incredibly cheap.  I think this is because prices in the UK are kept low because of constant supermarket price wars and competition from rivals like Lidl and Aldi.  What was odd for me when I moved to Spain was that food is much more seasonal here. In the UK you can buy fruit and veg all year round because it's flown in from the other side of the world.

Not saying you are lying, but in my time in the UK I found food to have higher prices (but not too much), and a common thing the Erasmus students from the rest of Europe say is that food here is way cheaper...  And about the seasonal fruit and veg: many of those food come from the south of Spain so I guess we give more importance of buying those rather that some fruit that comes from the other side of the world (it's also a cultural thing, in restaurants they tend to give importance to the season while they offer some food or another)   9",594

Austin isn't as pricey as those other places yet. There are also a few up-and-coming tech places that are (to date) relatively affordable such as Reno, NV. Reno used to be Las Vegas's seen-better-days older brother, but they've been getting spillover from the Bay Area along the I-80 corridor. There's also other mid/small cities you probably haven't heard of where you might be able to land something, depending on what it is that you do.  Again, it depends on what you do. If you could land something in Minneapolis or Chicago your dollar would go further than in New York or the SF Bay Area.

In 2017 this figure for the EU as a whole was 12,2% (eurostat) which would suggest that food is actually cheaper in the US, considering the average income. However, it has to be said that within the EU there were significant differences, according to this data from eurostat it was just 8,2% in the UK and 8,9% in Luxemburg, but 21,6% in Lithuania and 27,8% in Romania!

Whereas in US buying fresh produce would end up being more expensive than fast food.

114,Cheesetoastie86,England,1,"· edited 2 yr. ago  England An interesting series on CNN earlier this year had Kamau Bell visit different areas, including meeting some farmers in OK. They explained how they're getting totally shafted by agri businesses: https://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2020/07/23/united-shades-family-farms-clip-1.cnn  The farmer says he makes a nickel for a box of $5 cereal. You guys- consumers & farmers- are getting completely shafted in this. The main reason it doesn't change is that American politicians are incentivised to maintain the status quo, due to powerful lobbying from industry. In our countries, theres either no equivalent lobby, or its far, far less powerful. The Eu sets a lot of farming regs, but there's still seem room for individual countries to set their own policies. The other reason is that you guys seem to care less overall, about food standards.  Ironically, the US actually has far lower standards of farming than we do, both crops and animal welfare, which makes food cheaper to produce- so your grocery bills should be lower than ours.  That's been highlighted recently in the negations in the trade deal between the US and UK over chlorinated chicken. The US wants to ship that stuff over here- but the UK public, farmers, and food companies vehemently oppose it. American chicken needs to be chlorinated because it carries an unusually high amount of unhealthy bacteria etc- due to really low farming standards. While most people here wouldn't buy it, some would, which is regarded as undesirable- it'd undercut British chicken producers, who have higher legal standards, but its also allowing cruelty to win out. The Uk already has some of the highest animal welfare regs in Europe/ the world, and as we leave the EU and set our own farming laws, that's being set higher, inc better ecological standards too. There's also a huge and unnecessary carbon footprint from a food we can raise here ourselves- its not a protected food like champagne etc, which is regional specific. In the UK, ""British grown"" or ""grown in the EU"" foods are massively popular. Partly its investing in your local (or nearby) economy, partly its about carbon emissions, but a huge part's knowing its produced to high standards. I saw a yt video on some Americans living here, who said fruit & veg tasted ""fresher"" here, but went off faster- cos it has less chemicals sprayed on it. And most of the UK fruit and veg are imported (Spain, North Africa), so has a longish travel time- you can transport food, keeping it fresh, without slathering it in chemicals. America just chooses not to.  So a better question is to ask why American consumers don't press for better farming standards; fewer chemicals, better animal welfare, and dont try to get huge corporations squeezed out of the food chain. They're the ones coining it in, not the farmers.   1",2846
115,TheThiege,United States of America,2,"United States of America Only about 5% of US chicken is chlorinated, and food borne illness in the US is lower than in Europe  Drinking water in the UK is chlorinated...   0",173
116,Cheesetoastie86,England,3,"· edited 2 yr. ago  England Its nothing to do with ingesting chorline per se. Its an animal welfare issue, and the lack of any need to import something we dont need or want anyway, but will cause huge environmental damage through carbon emissions. Animal welfare in farming is a huge deal here, eg major supermarkets use free range eggs in their own brand meals. Brits are also more environmentally conscious than Americans.  We also dont want to undercut our own foods with cheaper imports which are produced to lower, and much more cruel, standards. The entire reason American chicken meat is chlorinated is cos it's reared in bad conditions.Those practices are literally illegal here.  food borne illness in the US is lower than in Europe  Well, Europe is comprised of 44 different countries, all of which have different standards and practices on everything, so this comment doesnt really say much. Europe includes some very poor countries, some of which are not in the EU, who are not subject to its standards.  The UK, however, is currently negotiating a trade deal with the US, and we have some of the highest animal welfare requirements in the world. Chlorine is used to wash off bacteria cos the chickens are kept in conditions which are literally shit- antimicrobial treatments are basically used to compensate for poor hygiene in farms.  Recent thread discussing this: https://old.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/jrzpre/cant_the_uk_label_us_chlorinated_chicken_as_such/  Article from The Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/03/the-truth-about-chlorinated-chicken-review-an-instant-appetite-ruiner  You (American consumers) dont benefit from this at all- your food is more expensive, but made to lower standards, cos big companies rip off consumers and farmers.  If another country has higher food standards than you, why don't you want that for yourselves? And if food in general is cheaper there too, why wouldn't you want to change things in the US? Youre being ripped off.  One of the first things the UK did on leaving the EU was to reform our agriculture policy, eg, with more stringent ecological protection laws on farms. We progress on this this stuff- dont you guys want to?   1",2218

Honestly higher prices would lead to the collapse of our country.  I know that you guys always think that we are rich af. And yes its true that our salaries are higher than yours, but they are not high enough to live a decent life here.

(but nearly the same for higher salaries) Furthermore our pension and health care system is better because it doesnt know 2 classes.  Was a bit offtopic but what I wanted to say is that the problem is our really high real estate prices are the problem.
